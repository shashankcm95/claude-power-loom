# 50 — Agent personas (`agents/*.md`)

The `agents/` directory holds the **Agent-tool persona definitions** — the top
layer of the toolkit's intentional **3-layer persona split**. Each file is a
thin Markdown agent definition whose YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
`tools:`, `model`, `color`) is what the Claude Code Agent/Task tool reads to
spawn a sub-agent by `subagent_type` (a.k.a. `agentType`). Per **ADR-0012**, the
frontmatter `tools:` field is the **single source of capability truth** — the
harness honors it statically at spawn time, and a build-time reconciliation
validator (`packages/runtime/orchestration/contracts-validate.js`,
`agent-contract-capability-reconcile`) binds each numbered persona contract's
declared traits back to this `tools:` floor. The body of most files is a
deliberately minimal **delegation stub** pointing at the authoritative identity
brief in `packages/runtime/personas/NN-<name>.md` and the persona contract in
`packages/runtime/contracts/NN-<name>.contract.json`. Three files (`architect.md`,
`code-reviewer.md`, `security-auditor.md`) keep full inline bodies instead of
delegating, because their Layer-1 output-contracts must stay guaranteed-in-prompt;
they sit outside the generator's managed roster and are model-tier-pinned by its
`FAT_AGENTS` guard (`scripts/generate-persona-agents.js`). (`optimizer` + `planner`
were thinned into the managed roster in #533 and now delegate to `18-optimizer` /
`19-planner` like the rest.)

The 3-layer split is **canonical and must not be "deduped"** (per `CLAUDE.md`
and the migration-rot arc #251–#258): `agents/<name>.md` (spawn shim + capability
floor) → `packages/runtime/personas/NN-<name>.md` (full identity brief, the
"wisdom") → `packages/runtime/contracts/NN-<name>.contract.json` (required
skills, `kb_scope`, budget, `functional` + `antiPattern` verification checks +
capability traits).

Reconciliation coverage boundary (from `contracts-validate.js`): the `write`
axis (`Edit`/`Write` → `worktree_writable` trait) is bound **both** directions
(floor-missing + over-grant); the `subprocess` axis (`Bash` →
`bash_test_runner`) binds only the over-grant direction; the `network` axis is
**deliberately un-reconciled** (no Claude Code `tools:` referent — egress is
audited at runtime by `kernel/observability/network-egress-audit.js`). The
un-numbered template contracts `challenger.contract.json` and
`engineering-task.contract.json` plus their `_lib/trait-resolve.js` and
`traits/_registry.json` are skipped by the gate (no single agent.md floor).

## Per-file catalog

### Read-only review/verify lenses (no `Edit`/`Write` — compliant with persona-selection Rule 3)

- **`architect.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. System-design lens for
  trade-offs, ADRs, scalable patterns. **Full inline body** (run
  `wc -l agents/architect.md` for the live count) — the canonical Layer 1+2
  reference for foundational principles (SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI), the KB
  canonical-references section, and the requirements-checklist output contract.
  (The strict `kb:<id>` citation-format convention enforced by the
  `kb-citation-gate` PostToolUse hook was EXTRACTED to `kb:hets/citation-format`
  at persona-depth W2 — the persona stubs + Layer-2 briefs now cross-reference
  that shared doc, not `architect.md`.)
- **`code-reviewer.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob","Bash"]`, **sonnet**.
  Correctness/quality/security/perf review lens; `Bash` for running checks. Full
  inline body (126 lines).
- **`honesty-auditor.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. Claim-vs-evidence
  rater; re-rates scorecards/shipping claims against artifacts. Delegation stub →
  `05-honesty-auditor`.
- **`hacker.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob","Bash"]`, opus. Offensive-security
  lens (SSRF/IDOR/injection/auth-bypass); `Bash` for live PoC probes — matches
  the Rule-2a "re-probe the BUILT code" discipline. Delegation stub →
  `01-hacker`.
- **`planner.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. Planning specialist for
  multi-file/phased work. Thinned into the managed roster in #533 — delegation
  stub → `19-planner` (Mindset + plan-template migrated into the Layer-2 brief).
- **`confused-user.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. Usability adversary;
  reads docs/errors/UI from a newcomer's perspective. Delegation stub →
  `02-confused-user`.
- **`codebase-locator.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. "Where is X?"
  file/symbol/reference finder. Delegation stub → `14-codebase-locator`.
- **`codebase-analyzer.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. Deep-read analyst
  (what does it do, who calls it, deps). Delegation stub → `15-codebase-analyzer`.
- **`codebase-pattern-finder.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob"]`, opus. Cross-file
  duplication / anti-pattern / missing-abstraction detector. Delegation stub →
  `16-codebase-pattern-finder`.

### Write-capable builder personas (`Edit`/`Write` present → must carry `worktree_writable`)

- **`node-backend.md`** — full write tools, opus. Node/Express/NestJS/TS backend
  builder. Delegation stub → `13-node-backend`. (Note the known `13-node-backend`
  vs bare `node-backend` key-fragment seam in the verdict-attestation / reputation
  tracks — a documented laundering lever, not a bug here.)
- **`python-backend.md`** — full write tools, opus. **Newest persona** (#353,
  ③.1-W4a) — the real-corpus subject for the persona experiment. Delegation stub →
  `17-python-backend`.
- **`react-frontend.md`** — full write tools, opus. React/Next/TS UI builder
  (Server Components, a11y). Delegation stub → `09-react-frontend`.
- **`ios-developer.md`** — full write tools, opus. Swift/SwiftUI builder; pairs
  with the `swift-development` on-demand skill. Delegation stub → `06-ios-developer`.
- **`java-backend.md`** — full write tools, opus. JVM/Spring/Kafka builder.
  Delegation stub → `07-java-backend`.
- **`ml-engineer.md`** — full write tools, opus. ML pipelines / LLM integration /
  eval harness builder. Delegation stub → `08-ml-engineer`.
- **`data-engineer.md`** — full write tools, opus. ETL/warehouse/dbt/Airflow
  builder. Delegation stub → `11-data-engineer`.
- **`devops-sre.md`** — full write tools, opus. k8s/Helm/Terraform/observability
  builder. Delegation stub → `10-devops-sre`.
- **`security-auditor.md`** — `["Read","Write","Edit","Bash","Grep","Glob"]`,
  **sonnet**. The one **Write-capable security** persona (remediation, not
  read-only review). **Full inline body** (107 lines). Maps to
  `12-security-engineer` via the **name alias** in `contracts-validate.js`
  (`AGENT_NAME_ALIASES = { 'security-engineer': 'security-auditor' }`). Per the
  persona-selection discipline this persona must NOT be wired into a read-only
  review pass (use `hacker` for adversarial review).
- **`optimizer.md`** — `["Read","Grep","Glob","Bash","Edit"]` (`Edit` but **no
  `Write`**), **sonnet**. Harness/config optimizer (agent perf, hook efficiency,
  context budget, MCP health). Thinned into the managed roster in #533 —
  delegation stub → `18-optimizer`. Its `Edit`-without-`Write` grant is the only
  partial-write capability set in the directory.

## Findings

| Severity | Level | Type | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MEDIUM | component | smell | `CLAUDE.md` (signpost table) | Stale persona counts: signpost says `personas/ (16 bodies)`, `contracts/ (20)`, `agents/*.md (18)`. Actual: **17** personas, **19** contracts (17 numbered + 2 templates), **19** agent files. All three drifted by one when `python-backend` (`17`) was forged in #353 (`43fd29d`); the contract `(20)` figure also never matched (always 19). Update to 17 / 19 / 19. |
| LOW | file | smell | `agents/security-auditor.md` vs `runtime/personas/12-security-engineer.md` | Cross-layer **name mismatch**: the agent file is `security-auditor` but its Layer 2/3 slot is `security-engineer`. Handled by an explicit alias (`AGENT_NAME_ALIASES`) so the capability-reconcile gate binds correctly, and documented in `contracts-validate.js`, but it is a standing footgun — the only persona where the basename diverges from its numbered slot. A rename (or a documented invariant note in an `agents/README.md`) would remove the special case. |
| RESOLVED (#533) | component | smell | `agents/optimizer.md`, `agents/planner.md` | Was: two agent-only personas with no Layer 2/3. **Resolved in #533** — both thinned into the generator's managed roster with Layer 2/3 briefs + contracts (`18-optimizer` / `19-planner`), so `agent-contract-capability-reconcile` now binds their `tools:` floor. The follow-up `--check` gate (row below) additionally content-governs + model-tier-pins every managed stub. |
| LOW | component | gap | `agents/` (directory root) | **No `agents/README.md`.** The directory is the top layer of a canonical 3-layer split and the single source of capability truth (ADR-0012), yet there is no in-directory index explaining the delegation pattern, the 17-vs-19 count, the `security-auditor`↔`security-engineer` alias, or the agent-only `optimizer`/`planner`. `CLAUDE.md` carries a one-line pointer but it is the stale-count source above. A short README would localize the invariant and reduce the count-drift recurrence. |
| LOW | file | optimization | `agents/architect.md` (body) | The three remaining full-inline-body files (`architect`, `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor` — run `wc -l agents/{architect,code-reviewer,security-auditor}.md` for live counts) break the otherwise-uniform "thin delegation stub" pattern (the other 16 files defer to the persona brief). All three DO have Layer 2/3 briefs, so their inline content partially duplicates the authoritative brief — a consolidation/dedup opportunity. (Persona-depth W2 already extracted the widely-cited citation-format convention out of `architect.md` to `kb:hets/citation-format` and repointed all citers, so the earlier "must remain reachable if moved" caveat is resolved.) #533 already thinned `optimizer`/`planner` out of this set; the remaining three are the endorsed "stay fat" boundary (Layer-1 output-contracts must stay guaranteed-in-prompt), model-tier-pinned by the generator's `FAT_AGENTS` guard. |
| INFO | component | smell | `agents/*.md` (frontmatter) | **Capability grants are consistent with the persona-selection discipline.** All four review/verify lenses (`architect`, `code-reviewer`, `honesty-auditor`, `hacker`) are read-only (Rule 3 compliant); `security-auditor` and the domain builders are Write-capable (correctly NOT used in read-only review passes). No capability drift or over-grant detected against the discipline. Model split: 16 opus / 3 sonnet (`code-reviewer`, `optimizer`, `security-auditor` are sonnet). |
| INFO | function | smell | `agents/*.md` (body, line ~11) | All 16 delegation stubs reference the Agent tool's "`subagent_type` requirement". The always-on rules and workflow docs use the term `agentType` for the same field. Both name the same selector, but the terminology is inconsistent across surfaces — harmless, noted for a future glossary pass. |
| INFO | component | fixed | `scripts/generate-persona-agents.js` (`--check`) | **Stub-drift + model-tier gate (W1 follow-up: M1 + L1).** `--check` is now a directory-integrity gate, not a presence check: every managed `agents/*.md` must be byte-identical to `renderAgentMd` (a hand-edit — incl. a flipped `model:` — fails); the 3 fat agents are model-tier-pinned via `FAT_AGENTS` + must stay fat (no in-place thinning); the two rosters partition the whole directory (an ungoverned new stub fails `orphaned`); and `--force` refuses a roster conflict before writing. Closes the deferred M1 (content-blind `--check`) + L1 (unguarded fat sonnet tiers). The 7 previously hand-curated stubs were reconciled into the generator via new `kbExtra`/`broaderScope` fields (SSOT). |
